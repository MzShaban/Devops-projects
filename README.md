## Azure Pipelines with Classic Editor

Azure Pipelines is a powerful continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) platform provided by Microsoft Azure. The Classic Editor in Azure Pipelines allows you to define your build and release pipelines using a graphical interface. This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and configure Azure Pipelines using the Classic Editor.

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

1. An Azure DevOps organization: You need an Azure DevOps organization to create and manage your pipelines. If you don't have one, you can create a new organization or use an existing one.

2. A repository with your source code: Azure Pipelines integrates with various source control systems like Git, GitHub, Azure Repos, and more. Make sure your source code repository is set up and accessible.
